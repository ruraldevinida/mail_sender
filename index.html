    <br>

    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>here is no universal accepted meaning about  Rural Development. It is comprehensive and Multi-dimensional and Multi  context.  The  World  Bank  1975  defined  Rural  Development  as  “A  strategy  aiming  at  the  improvement  of Economic  and  social  living  conditions  focusing  a  specific  groupof  poor  people  in  rural  area.  It  assist  the  poorest groups. According to Robbert Chambers Rural Development is a strategy to enable a specific group of poorpeople, women and men to gain economic benefit and social development. Thus Rural Development study encompasses the education,health,agriculture, forest,tourism, employment,eradication of poverty etc.Assam  is  situated  in  the  middle  of  the  North  East.  About  80%  people  are  in  rural  area.  Agriculture  is  their  main livelihood. Industry, market, communication, health etc. are all relation with Agriculture. As Assam is chronic flood affected area and far from central Government Administration,most, rural area of  Assam remain unpaid attention. Besides,as  agriculture  is the  main  livelihood  of  the  people  of  rural  areas,low  income,  unemployment,  scarcity  of food,  fodder  lack  of  irrigation  etc.  are  mainly  due  to  low  level  of  agriculture  in  rural  area.  Health  and  education problem  can  be  solved  when  rural  areas  improved  in  livelihood,Contd................p/2(2)e.g.-agriculture.  Low level of livelihood effect in every  field of rural area in socio-economic, political,religion,  education etc. Now the Assam  Government  in  collaboration  with  Central  Government  has  jointly  implemented  various  policies  and programmes  aiming  rural  development.  Minimum  needs  programme  (1973).  Integrated  Rural  Development Programme    (IRDP,  1778),National  Rural  Employment  Programme  (NREP,1980),  Training  for  Rural  Youth  for Self-Employment  (TRYSEM,  1979),  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Act  (NREGA,2005)  etc.  are  notable among  them.  But  these    plan  and  programme  are  not  yet  fully  reached  and  implemental  for  various  reasons  of illiteracy, ignorant,lack of confidence, structural defects of plan and programmes etc.</p>

    <h3>INTERPRETETIONS</h3>
    <p>The  people  in  rural  areas  of  Assam  are  mainly  depended  on  agriculture  80%  people  are  agriculturists.  But  due  to traditional    methods    of    cultivation,  production  is  very  low.  Farmers  are  far  from  using  high  technology  in production  methods.  Floods  and  other  natural  calamities  like  pests  damaged  half  percent  of  agriculture.  In  1986 environment  protection  law  was  formed.  For  environment  protection  both  Government  and  public  has  working together in implementing plan and programme smoothly.Unemployment, illiteracy and poverty are also serious problems of rural areas in Assam. Now Government of India as  well  as  Assam  Government has  jointly  implemented new  schemes  and  policies  to  abolish  these  problems.  Mid-Day-Meal scheme, IAY, SGRY, National Maternity benefit scheme etc. are among them. Besides prevailing socio-cultural  factors  of  family  also  influenced  the  rural  people,  mainly  nuclear  or  joint  family  is  prevalent  in  Assam, which influenced every society in rural area in socio-economic condition. Laziness, drudgery are other problems that needs  to  be  tackle.  To  achieve  this  purpose  human  resources  management  facilities  should  be  provided  for  the growth and development of their inner potentialities. Also Assam is very rich in diversity of natural resources. But due to lack of technological knowledge and skill these resources are yet to be utilized in developmental purpose.</p>
